# CAVE - Simplified Virtual Reality for Quantifying Animal Behaviour
CAVE is an open source project developed by the XXXX designed to streamline the process of setting up a Tethered Flight Arena.

CAVE leverages both the [Unity Editor](https://unity.com/products/unity-engine) and [DeepLabCut](https://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut) to deliver a flexible and low latency platform for quantifying animal behaviour.

The CAVE project provides users with the following
- A preconfigured Unity project which contains an interface and scripts that allow for the creation and control of experiments without the need for code.
- Modifications to DeepLabCut-live which allow it to provide the Unity Editor with real time pose estimation data.
- Documentation and resources to help with the installation, configuration and utilisation of CAVE and the 3rd party software it relies on.
